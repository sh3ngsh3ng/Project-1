## Phase 5: UX Planning
### 1) Strategy

#### Target Audience:
- Consumers
    - The General Public
    - Foodie (a person with a particular interest in food)
- Age + IT Literacy: Younger audience who are more tech savvy
- Pain Points:
    - Not sure what to eat, indecisive.
    - May be unfamiliar with the place. E.g. User's first time in the area.
    - Might have "cravings" for a certain type of food.
    - Might have diet restrictions. E.g. halal, vegetarian, vega, etc.
- Needs: 
    - Information on food around user's location
        - Dining types: Restaurants, cafes, bars, etc
        - Dietary: Halal, vegetarian, etc
        - Certain Type of Food: Chicken rice, Laksa, etc
    - Recommendations of good food around user's location

#### The User Stories:
<!-- format: as a (what), I want (goal) so that (benefit) -->
- As a foodie, I want to **find out what are the nice food/interesting places to eat** so that I can try them out!
- As a non-foodie, I want **convenience when searching for food** so that I don't have to spend time researching and worrying about what to eat!

### 2) Scope

    - For 
- Distance Input

#### Non-functional
